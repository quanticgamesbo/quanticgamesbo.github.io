Puma Punku is an action/adventure game being developed by the team.

### ExpoBix
The last videogame we are working on is called Puma Punku and while working on it we had the luck to win the award for Best Audio at Expobix 2019. For the competition, organised by the Bolivian Video Game Association, we created the first version of this game  in about 13 days. As we tried our best to create the best experience, we relied on our individual talents to finish the game on time. Thankfully, our efforts were good enough to win that prize.
